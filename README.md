# eye-native

This is the native library for the eye-candy and eye-projector repositories. Check it out into a sibling directory to the eye-candy and eye-projector directories.

This project requires OpenCV. You will need to update the paths in *binding.gyp* to the location where you install the OpenCV headers and library.

Build the library by running `yarn`.
